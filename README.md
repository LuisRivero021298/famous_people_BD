# Famous People whit BD
An API of famous people whose objective is that developers can use it locally and test their front-end applications. This is the version that has BD (MongoDB).
## Getting Starting üöÄ

_These instructions allow you to obtain a copy of the project in operation on your local machine for development and testing parameters._

### Pre requirements üìã

#### MongoDB 
The first thing you should do is install **MongoDB**, the following link will tell you how to do it: https://www.mongodb.com/download-center/community
**Install the community server version.**

After installing MongoDB, we go (in case of windows) our local disk C and create a folder called data and within data another folder called db (in this all databases will be stored).

Now, we go to where our mongoDB was installed (in my case C://Program files/MongoDb) and we look for the file **mongod.exe** (in my case the path is: /Server/4.2/bin/mongod.exe) you we double click and it will start running.

To verify that we install mongoDB we double click on its console (mongo.exe) and execute the following command:
```
show.dbs;
```
Show the default databases (admin, config, local).

#### Compass
Compass is a tool to manage database in MongoDB, it also allows us to export and import collections very easily, to download: https://docs.mongodb.com/compass/master/install/

#### Node.js
The second thing you should do is install nodejs, the following link will tell you how to do it: https://nodejs.org/en/download/

Then you must verify which version has been installed.
```
node -v
```
The next thing we are going to do is verify the version of the NPM package manager installed, for this using the open console we execute the following command:
```
npm -v
```
#### Execute a javascript file in the node server
Finally we will create a JavaScript file to run and test the installation of Node.js.
For this we create a file called test.js and to which we will add _the following code:_
```
console.log('Node is installed correctly!');
```
Then we position ourselves within the location where we created the test.js file and execute the following command from the console:
```
node test.js
```
If everything went well it will show us the message ‚ÄúNode is installed correctly!‚Äù.


## Installation üîß

#### You must clone the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/LuisRivero021298/famous_people_BD.git
```
#### _Within the project you must execute the following commands:_

**-1** The first command will create a folder called node_modules (all the modules we are going to use are stored) and we will install express and morgan.
_You can read more about express in the following link: https://expressjs.com/guide/routing.html_
```
npm i express morgan --save
```
**-2** Now we are going to install connect-multiparty a library that allows us to upload files.
```
npm i connect-multiparty --save
```
**-3** We will install mongoose which is an ORM to use with MongoDB.
```
npm i mongoose --save
```
**-4** We will install validator, library that allows us to make validations from the back end.
```
npm i validator --save
```
**-5** Then you must install nodemon (this module restarts the server for us and the changes will be shown without the need to close and open the server)
```
npm i nodemon -D
```
**-6** After installing all the necessary modules, we open MongoDB Compass (we must have run mongod.exe), click on the CREATE DATABASE button, and create the famous_people BD and collection famouspeoples.

**-7** We select the famouspeoples collection and at the top we click on the Collection option, select the Import Data option, a pop-up window will appear, select the Browse button, select the famous_people.json file that is inside the project and you already have the collection in your database give data.

**-8** To prove that the server works correctly, we will execute the following command in the console:
```
npm run dev
```
You should display the following message on the console: *"server on port 3000"*

#### Congratulations, you already have the api running on your machine!
